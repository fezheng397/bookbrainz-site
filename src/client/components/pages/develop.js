				We aim to make it as easy as possible to use the data
				stored in BookBrainz. If you&rsquo;re a developer wanting
				to make programs that depend on BookBrainz, we have a web
				service available, and are releasing database
				dumps regularly.
			</p>

			<h2>Web Service</h2>
			<p>
				The web service is the primary way of getting BookBrainz
				data. The key advantage of using the web service over the
				dumps is that you don&rsquo;t need to install any database
				engine &mdash; you can access the data through the internet.
				The web service is documented in&nbsp;
				<a href="http://bbdocs-dev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">
					our Developer Documentation.
				</a>.
			</p>

			<h2>Database Dumps</h2>
			<p>
				The database dumps will be useful if you need to process a
				lot of data quickly &mdash; in cases where the web service
				is not able to respond quickly enough.
				The latest database dump can be found <a href="/dumps/latest.sql.bz2">at this address</a>.
				A dump is made every week.
			</p>
			<h2>Source Code</h2>
			<p>
				BookBrainz runs on open source software. If you wish to
				access the source, even contribute to the project, please
				see&nbsp;
				<a href="https://github.com/bookbrainz/">
					our github page
				</a>.
