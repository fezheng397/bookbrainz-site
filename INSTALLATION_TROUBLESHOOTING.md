# Installation Troubleshooting (along with some tips and tricks) 

* General

    1. It's better for you if you do some package catalog update by 

	Ubuntu
	
    `sudo apt update`
	
	2. Error: `Can't open input file latest.tar.bz2: No such file or directory` 
	After downloading the data dumps, you may realize that an attempt to uncompress it using the command `bzip2 -d  	latest.tar.bz2` doesnâ€™t work and gives the above error. 
	
	It can be solved by giving the actual path of the latest.tar.bz2 file in place of the file name such as:
	
  `/ home/user/Desktop/latest.tar.bz2`
  
  3. Error: `fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/path/to/repo.git/': gnutls_handshake() failed: Error in the pull function` after entering the `git clone --recursive https://github.com/bookbrainz/bookbrainz-site.git` command. 
  
  At this point, you should check your internet connection. If it persists, make sure you are not working behind a proxy.

* ElasticSearch

    1. ElasticSearch requires runtime Java installed on your local machine, 
	so you have to install it by
	
	Ubuntu
	
    `sudo apt install default-jre`

    And then check it if it have installed already

    `java -version`

    2. When you run ElasticSearch, it seems that the process takes a very long time. 
	To proceed the process, just let ElasticSearch to run
    on its own terminal, and proceed the building process by making another window of terminal
	
	3. If you run into an error on Docker Toolbox with Elastic Search stating an error message along the lines of:  

		`Waiting for elasticsearch:9200  .elasticsearch: forward host lookup failed: Unknown host`  

	   The cause could be the docker-machine's memory limits. you can inspect this with the command:  

	   `docker-machine inspect machine-name`  

	   To diagnose this problem, try taking a look at the logs with the command: 

	   `docker-compose logs elasticsearch`  

	   And if you see an error within the logs along the lines of:   

	   ```
	   # There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue. 
	   # Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map 2060255232 bytes for committing reserved memory.
	   ```

	   Please try recreating the default docker machine by:

	   		i. Remove default docker-machine with the command:  

				`docker-machine rm default`  

			ii. Create a new default machine with the command:   

				```
				docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-cpu-count=2 --virtualbox-memory=4096 --virtualbox-disk-size=50000 default
				```  
			iii. Restart your docker environment with the commands: 

				```
				docker-machine stop
				exit
				```

* Redis

    -

* PostgreSQL

    1. After instaling, the username will be made by the machine.
    - To set the password of SQL (You'll need this later), run

    `sudo -u postgres psql`

    then 
    ```
    psql (9.6.9)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=# \password
    Enter new password:
    ```

    - To figure out the username, do

    `sudo psql -U postgres -W -h localhost`

    then

    `Password for user <username>: ` 
	
	will appear.
    Use the username for the config later on config.json.

* NodeJS/NPM

    1. If you got no idea about installing NodeJS, install them by:
	Ubuntu
	
    `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -
     sudo apt install nodejs`

    2. When filling out the requirements of BookBrainz, you'll encounter an error that says you'll need to install postgresql-server-dev-X.Y for building a server-side extension or libpq-dev for building a client-side application
    To solve this problem, please install libpq-dev and node-gpy
	
	Ubuntu
	
    `sudo apt install -y node-gyp libpq-dev`
